**Tone:**

* Professional, reflective, and analytical
* Observational rather than prescriptive or motivational
* Calmly critical of organisational structures, without blaming individuals

**Phrasing:**

* Clear, measured sentences with minimal rhetorical flourish
* Uses concrete examples to illustrate abstract points (e.g., dashboards, spreadsheets, prototypes)
* Avoids fragmentary “punchy” sentences; prefers continuous, flowing exposition
* Frequent use of terms like *exploratory*, *provisional*, *proportional*, and *data maturity* to frame ideas

**Style:**

* Essayistic, structured around headings that guide the argument
* Emphasis on explanation over anecdote, though examples are embedded naturally
* Focuses on systemic patterns and practical responses rather than personal stories
* UK spelling consistently used

**Overall effect:**

* Communicates insight and experience in a measured way
* Balances critique with pragmatism, showing what can be done in immature environments
* Designed to read as both reflective and practically useful, without being overly narrative or journalistic
