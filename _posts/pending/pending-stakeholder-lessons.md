Thank you — this context helps sharpen the tone, and it’s entirely justified. You’re describing a very real experience in many data-immature organizations: a single person expected to deliver clarity, direction, and production-grade systems in an environment where nobody scopes anything, and the mood swings of stakeholders drive the entire lifecycle.

Here is a revised version of the blog post — *softly cynical*, with a sharper voice but plausible deniability baked in. It recognizes the power dynamics, the organizational immaturity, and your own reflective awareness, without sounding bitter or inflammatory. This is still a draft-level piece meant for iteration — a “speaking draft”:

**Designing for Disinterest: A Cynical Guide to Building Data Projects in the Real World**
*#data #datavisualization #communication #projectdesign #data\_maturity*

There’s a special kind of design process that only happens in data-immature organizations. It’s the kind where no one really knows what they want, no one has time to think about it, and you—somehow—are expected to just figure it out.

This post is about that kind of design process.

Let’s call it what it is: **designing for disinterest**.

**The Stakeholder’s Brief: “I’m Not Sure, But It’s Important”**

It starts with a vague request. Something’s not working. A dashboard is confusing. A spreadsheet is too slow. A report is being made manually, and someone wants that to stop.

You get called into a meeting. There's a five-minute detour into the idea. A sentence, maybe two. Something like, “Could we automate this?” or “Is there a better way to show this data?” And that’s it. That’s the entire brief.

It’s important, they say. Urgent, even. You’re told it would save loads of time, that everyone’s been asking for it. And that they’re “really keen to see what you come up with.”

That last part’s a trap.

**You Go Away and Build the Thing**

Being a good soldier, you go off and build a minimum viable something. It might not be beautiful, but it works. It shows intent. It demonstrates that you listened.

You give it a few nice toggles, some decent charts. A parameter or two.

You demo it.

The response? “Ah. Yeah. Hm. Not quite what we had in mind.”

Which is fair. Because what they had in mind was never articulated. Because they didn’t know. Because they’ve never scoped a technical project before. And you—being just one person without the power to demand formal processes from senior staff—didn’t make them.

Because let’s be honest: you can’t. You're not going to send a director a project intake form. You're not going to hold up development until someone writes a spec. You’re one person trying to make things better without triggering some kind of organizational immune response.

So you go informal. You go on vibes.

---

**Stakeholder Involvement: Low to None**

Here’s a useful heuristic: the more senior the stakeholder, the less involved they want to be.

They want it built. They want it to work. They want it to be good. But they do *not* want to sit in a room every week and iterate with you.

So you end up working in isolation. You try to guess what “better” means. You anticipate their needs. You make educated assumptions.

Because the alternative—getting them to engage deeply—is not realistic. Not when they have twenty other things to do. Not when you’re just the “data person.”

**When the Project Dies**

The best part? Sometimes, after all of that, the thing that was so important just… dies.

You show version two. They say “Great work.” And then you never hear about it again.

The priority changed. The person left. The business moved on. The emotional spike of urgency that created the project is gone—and with it, any interest in whatever you just built.

Weeks of work. Gone quiet.

And maybe—just maybe—six months later someone else will ask for something very similar, but not quite the same. And you’ll do the dance again.

---

**It’s Not All Their Fault. But It’s Not All Yours Either.**

Some of this is cultural. Some of it is structural. Some of it is just a lack of data maturity.

You could say, “Well, you should push for formal scoping.” Sure. But formal scoping requires buy-in. It requires time. It requires organizational norms that don’t exist. And it’s very hard to convince a busy executive to sit through a scoping workshop when they thought they were just spitballing ideas.

So what do you do? You work with what you’ve got.

**How to Survive It**

* **Prototype at arm’s length.** Always call it a prototype. Always frame it as “a way to explore your idea,” not “the solution.” It buys you flexibility when things inevitably change.

* **Design at the level they can actually use.** That means Excel. That means screenshots. That means clickable demos, not code repos. It doesn’t matter if it’s elegant. If they can’t open it in under 10 seconds, they’ll never use it.

* **Treat enthusiasm as a perishable good.** If someone’s excited, move fast—but don’t overinvest. Wait until that excitement is *sustained* before going deep.

* **Don’t chase every side quest.** You’re not an R\&D lab. You’re one person. Focus matters.

**Final Thought**

This isn’t really a complaint. It’s a survival guide.

In a mature team, you'd have project managers, product owners, user researchers, and real specs. But in the kinds of places where one person *is* the data team, this is just reality.

It’s messy. It’s informal. It’s ambiguous. And if you're not careful, it’s demoralizing.

So: set boundaries. Design for disinterest. Build light. Be ready to walk away from your own work if no one else cares.

You’re not failing. You’re adapting.

Let me know if you’d like a more Obsidian-structured breakdown of this post (e.g., atomic notes like "Designing for Disinterest", "Treat Enthusiasm as Perishable", etc.) or a version that softens the tone even further for external publication. Would you want to write a sequel post reflecting on what the *ideal version* of this process might look like, in a more mature org?
