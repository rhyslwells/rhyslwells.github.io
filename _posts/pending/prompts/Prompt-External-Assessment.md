Given a provided text get me  an overall assessment from an external reader.

Something like this

Overall assessment (external reader)

Clarity: High

Consistency of voice: Strong

Authenticity: Very strong

Flow: Good, with minor rhythm issues

Risk of sounding performative: Low (this is a big strength)

Nothing feels indulgent or inward-looking. An external reader will understand exactly what you are moving away from and exactly what you are moving toward, without being told how to feel about it.
