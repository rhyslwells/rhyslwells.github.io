### Before: Making the Trade-Off

Coming out of academia, I wasn’t looking for prestige—I was looking for something that made sense. Something I could get into quickly, that would give me stability, and that would get me closer to buying a house. The job market was terrible. I had no industry experience in data, couldn’t drive, and I was starting to run out of money. I didn’t have the luxury of holding out for something ideal. I just needed to get going.

What I found wasn’t flashy. It wasn’t a stretch role or anything that made people raise their eyebrows in excitement. But it was a job. It paid regularly, and it gave me something to anchor to while I figured out the rest of my life. That meant something, especially when everything else felt uncertain.

There was a strange kind of frustration in it, though. I knew I could do more—I *still* know that—but it didn’t matter. The role didn’t need more. It needed someone reliable, someone who could get the work done, day in, day out. There’s a humility to that, but also a weight. You feel boxed in. The work isn’t hard, but the time still has to be spent. And every week that passes, you wonder: *Is this time I’m investing—or just time I’m burning?*

What made it harder was seeing others who didn’t have to make that trade-off. People who had the financial support, or the network, or the timing that let them take risks. I was doing everything I could to build the basics. Pay bills. Learn to drive. Keep a roof over my head. And I felt, quietly, resentful that doing all that could somehow *still* feel like falling behind.

But I stuck with it. I gave myself permission to see it for what it was: a foundation. Not the end. Just a place to stand for a while. That helped. Not completely, but enough to keep moving.


## Middle: Growing Into the Box

At first, I was just trying to get through it. Everything felt new, even if the tasks themselves weren’t complex. I was learning the basics of working outside academia—working in teams, navigating ambiguity, getting things done without perfect context. I didn’t feel confident, but I showed up, did the work, and tried to pay attention.

Driving is probably the best metaphor I have for this period. I was learning to drive in real life at the same time. At first, it was exhausting. Every decision required focus. I doubted myself constantly. But eventually, muscle memory kicked in. The same thing happened with work. You learn how the place works. You understand the unspoken rules. You develop your systems, your shortcuts. You stop second-guessing yourself.

And that felt good, honestly. To feel capable. To not be afraid of every unknown. There’s value in learning how to manage the routine, how to be solid and dependable. I needed that phase.

But as I settled in, that old restlessness started to return. Once I could do the job well, I started to notice how small it was. How little room there was to try new things, to be challenged, to stretch. I had learned how to drive, but I wasn’t going anywhere new.

I started to feel the edges of the box. That subtle claustrophobia you get when you know something isn’t hard anymore, but you’re still doing it because it’s what's available. The environment hadn’t changed—but I had. And now, the very stability I once needed was becoming the thing I needed to move past.

## After: Ready for a Bigger Box

Now I’m in that in-between space. I’ve outgrown the box I’ve been in, and I know I’m ready for something bigger. Not just a promotion or a title—what I want is space. Space to think more broadly, to try harder problems, to be surrounded by people who stretch me. I’m not interested in being the smartest person in the room. I want to be in a room where I’m learning again.

But I’m cautious. Because I’ve learned that where you work matters—not just what the company says, but how it actually operates. You can’t see that from a job spec. You only learn it from inside. And I’m wary of stepping into another box that looks exciting but turns out to be just as limiting.

That’s the fear: wasting time. Going through the motions for another year in a place that can’t offer what you need. You don’t want to spend your energy climbing the wrong ladder. But you also don’t want to stall while waiting for perfect conditions.

Right now, I’m trying to figure out what shape the next box should be. I know some of my non-negotiables now: real learning opportunities, being around technically excellent people, a culture that values change, not just talks about it. I want to work with people who care, who take action, who are generous with their time and ideas—not just clocking in and out.

It’s a strange mix of feelings—gratitude for how far I’ve come, frustration at how slow it sometimes feels, and hope that the next phase will be more expansive. I’m looking for a challenge that doesn’t just demand more hours, but asks more of me—my thinking, my creativity, my resilience. I’m not trying to be comfortable. I’m trying to grow.

I don’t know yet what comes next. But I know what I’m ready for. And I’ll know the right environment when I see it—not because it’s perfect, but because it gives me room to move.
