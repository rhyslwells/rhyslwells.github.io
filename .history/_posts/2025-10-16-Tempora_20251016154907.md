## Building a Simple Time Series Forecasting App

Forecasting is a fundamental part of business, yet it’s often overlooked. Many organisations rely on basic tools, usually spreadsheets, even when their data could support more informed, forward-looking decisions.

I built a simple, accessible **time series analysis and forecasting application** in Streamlit to fill that gap. The goal was to provide a tool where users can explore and forecast univariate time series data quickly, without needing to write code or configure complex environments. Instead of creating a one-off solution for a specific problem, I wanted to build something that could be used across departments, saving time and avoiding repeated processes.

Time series forecasting can feel like an art. Trends, seasonality, and other components make it more involved than a straight-line projection. Many people shy away from it because it’s not obvious how to do it well. Done properly, it can have real business impact, helping with budgeting, planning, and operational decisions. My aim was to make it accessible: clear, easy to use, and free from unnecessary complexity.

The app guides users naturally from uploading their data to exploring it, transforming it, and finally generating forecasts. Users can visually inspect data, assess stationarity, run models like ARIMA and Prophet, and generate forecasts that are interpretable rather than black boxes. Tooltips and parameter explanations help users understand what’s happening at each step.

This project also connects to my broader work in [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/), where theoretical topics such as stationarity, autocorrelation are documented. Concepts are hyperlinked within the app, so users can quickly access deeper explanations if needed.

I’ve focused on **user experience** in this version. This one is refined, designed to provide real utility and bridge the gap between theory and practical application. I’ve kept the app general, so it can be used by anyone working with time-dependent data across sectors. Future updates may expand functionality based on user feedback, but for now, simplicity and accessibility remain the priority.

The main goal of this blog post is to invite users to try the app and provide feedback. If you work with time series data and want a tool that makes forecasting approachable, I encourage you to explore it and share your feedback.
