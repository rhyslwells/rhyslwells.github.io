## Modular, Practical Reference Repositories

MLTools and DETools are structured repositories designed to collect, distill, and organize key machine learning and data engineering concepts into concise, reusable modules.

Each repository is organized by topic (e.g., logistic regression, SVMs, feature engineering, data lake design). Within each topic, you’ll find small, focused notebooks containing:

* Minimal, working examples
* Links to relevant data or curated datasets
* Pointers to packages or APIs commonly used in practice
* Notes and references to clarify standard terms or techniques

The goal is not to teach from first principles or replicate full tutorials, but to provide well-scoped entry points into familiar and recurring problems. These are not snippets in the conventional sense, but structured anchor points—lightweight and adaptable.

This approach supports two key objectives:

1. Rapid orientation when revisiting a topic
2. Knowledge portability across tools and teams

Both repositories are closely linked to the Data Archive, which contains longer-form context, commentary, and additional links. Each notebook is referenced from the Archive and positioned within a broader technical or conceptual discussion. This creates a two-tiered structure:

* DETools/MLTools for direct, practical use
* Data Archive for broader framing, history, and analysis

These repositories are maintained to be implementation-neutral, focusing on clarity and reusability over integration with specific packages or frameworks. Where tools or packages are referenced, they are chosen for their practical utility rather than adherence to a single ecosystem.

These materials are used internally but are also designed to be shareable. The structure is modular so that other teams, researchers, or individuals can fork and extend them for their own knowledge workflows.
