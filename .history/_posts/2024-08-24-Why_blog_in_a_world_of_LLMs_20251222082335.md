# Why Blog in a World of LLMs? The Ideas!

Blogging gives me a platform to share my thoughts and musings. Crafting posts, however, isn’t always a straightforward journey; it requires time and patience to allow ideas to evolve.

For the type of content I deliver, the true value of a blog post lies in the ideas themselves. Therefore, the process of refining these ideas for clarity becomes highly valuable.

The biggest hurdle I face in sharing ideas is overcoming the inertia involved in transforming messy, abstract thoughts into coherent language that others can easily understand.

I use LLMs, like GPT, as a tool to bridge the gap between my ideas and their presentation, without getting bogged down by the details of word choices. My typical workflow involves:

1. **Brainstorming:** I jot down my initial ideas in a chaotic manner, often using Google Keep.  
2. **Structuring:** I organize these thoughts into a coherent structure, cutting and pasting content under given headers.  
3. **Drafting:** I feed this structured outline to an LLM, which generates a draft.

Here’s a video demonstrating my process:

<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <video controls autoplay loop muted style="width: 100%;">
    <source src="/assets/images/llm_editted.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>



4. **Editing and Refining:** I review the draft, making necessary edits and refinements - first on my tablet using a stylus (Google docs has a markup feature on tablet), then on the desktop where I input these edits.

5. **Uploading:** I finalize and publish the post.

By using LLMs in this way, I can speed up the process of transforming my ideas into engaging blog posts, allowing me to share my thoughts with the world more efficiently.
