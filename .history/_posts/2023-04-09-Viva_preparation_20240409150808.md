The final exam of a PhD is a viva. This a oral examination where you defend your thesis in front of a panel of examiners. While the prospect may seem daunting proper preparation can alleviate the associated anxiety. Here I summarise the preparation I used for my own viva. These notes where collected from seminars and online resources, in particular the [Viva Survivor](http://www.nathanryder.co.uk/courses/viva-survivor/).

# Expectations

## Procedure

Understanding the structure and expectations of your university's viva process is necessary. Consult university guidelines and ask your supervisor or recent graduates about the process to familiarise yourself with what to expect. 

## The examiners

You will no doubt know your examiners a few months in advance. Take the time to research your examiners' backgrounds and familiarise yourself with their work. This can provide valuable insights into their potential areas of interest and the types of questions they may pose. Remember, examiners are there to engage in constructive dialogue about your research and its implications. Their job is to explore your work and have a conversation, about:

- your novel contribution,
- methods and motivations of work,
- your capability as a researcher.

It is useful to keep in mind that they have had a viva in the past and know how it feels to be in your shoes.

When in the viva remember to stop and think, you don't need to give an answer to every question. You are there to have a discussion. Saying "I don't know" is perfectly fine, but obviously don't just leave it at that. Give a direction to look for the answer in and ask them a clarifying questions.

## The mental game

Remember perfection is not required. 

> You thesis is good enough, otherwise you would not have gotten this far. 

I say this because it is your supervisors job to ensure this.
# Preparation

I found it useful to create a "before the viva I will have" list. Here is mine:

I will have:
- Read through my thesis and made notes.
- Run through my presentation.
- Organised list of Potential questions with answers.
- Made a mind map of the thesis areas.
- Attached to each chapter a summary.

Where for the last point I tried to answer for each chapter:

- Why did I write this chapter:
- How did you go about the research in this chapter? 
- Summarise the main points:
- Outline your contribution and key conclusions.
- Write a list of key references.

## Potential questions

When preparing for my own viva. I thought the following questions where the most thought provoking.

### Personal motivations for pursuing a PhD

- Write one sentence about why you wanted to do a PhD.
- What about this topic interests you?
- What have you struggled with in your research?

### Overview of your thesis topic

- What is your thesis about? 
- What is the setting?
- What are the most recent developments in your field? 
- What are the strongest and the weakest points of your thesis?

### Novelty and significance

- What is the novel contribution? 
- How did you get to the novel contribution?
- Why is your work valuable and who is it valuable to? 
- What makes your research matter?
- What stands out about your research?

### Methodology

- How would you describe your methodology and why did you decide to use this?
- How do you know the computations are correct?

### Hindsight and improvements

- With hindsight, is there anything that you would change about your research?
- What would you do differently if you were to start again?
- How could your work be improved?

### Future looking

- What sections of your thesis do you think are publishable?
- Given the rate of development in your research area, how long will your contribution be seen as relevant?
- What would you like to see in the future?

# Conclusion

Approach your PhD viva with confidence and preparedness. Remember that it is not a test of perfection, but rather a conversation about your research. By thoroughly preparing and engaging with your examiners, you can navigate the viva process with if not ease, less anxiety.
