## When the Project Becomes the Process

Some projects are things you can finish. Others aren’t. The tricky part is, you rarely know which kind you’re dealing with at the start.

At first, everything looks tidy—clear tasks, a defined outcome, maybe even a rough timeline. But then you begin to realise you’re still just working out the shape of the thing. Like surveying ground before laying a foundation. Some parts are firm. Some are overgrown. You don’t always know what you’re stepping into until you're already ankle-deep.

This happens a lot in research-heavy work, or anything involving data and nuance. You might set out to solve a problem or build a tool, only to find yourself circling back, reframing, chasing odd leads. Even naming the problem properly can take longer than expected. And the more you learn, the more you notice what’s missing.

So what does “done” look like in that kind of work?

You end up leaning on something like “good enough.” It’s flexible—sometimes frustratingly so. When the project is clearly scoped and the targets are measurable, that phrase can actually mean something. If the data quality is over 95%, or the model does what it’s supposed to, fine—done. But in more open-ended work, that kind of clarity slips away. You start making judgement calls based on how much energy or interest you still have. Whether there’s still something useful left to uncover.

In those cases, you don’t always walk away with a finished product. What you get instead is a set of tools—mental shortcuts, habits, small discoveries that you can take into future work. You build up a kind of internal toolbox. A sense of what works, what’s reusable, and what’s worth refining. Maybe you log it in a repo. Maybe you just remember how to tackle that kind of knot next time. It’s not flashy, but it helps.

That doesn’t mean open-ended projects are easy to manage. They can stretch on forever. You fix one issue and another pops up. Like a hydra. You end up relying on some internal compass—asking whether the work is still doing something for you. Whether you're still learning, still seeing returns. Whether it's actually worth your time.

Because external feedback is rare. People want polish before they’ll weigh in, and polish usually comes too late. So you need to build up some resilience, maybe even some optimism. A belief that what you’re doing matters—even if only later, even if only to you.

And maybe that’s enough. If the work still teaches you something, still gives you something to carry forward, it doesn’t need to have a neat ending. It just needs to make you better prepared for the next one.
