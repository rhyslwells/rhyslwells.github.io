I've been thinking a lot recently about how some projects don't really end-they just shift shape. How not every piece of work ties off neatly. How some keep growing, branching, generating more questions than answers. And in those cases, how do you know when you've done enough? And what keeps you going?

I wrote a short reflection on managing open-ended projects, staying motivated, and building a personal toolbox along the way. I'd appreciate any thoughts or experiences you'd like to share.
