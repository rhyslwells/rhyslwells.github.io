I often need a repeatable environment to explore and forecast different models and parameters across time series data. That need motivated me to build Tempora, a Streamlit app for time series analysis and forecasting. 

Tempora lets users upload data, explore trends, run models like ARIMA or Prophet, and generate interpretable forecasts (without writing code). 

The goal of this project was to make forecasting accessible for anyone working with time series data. If you have time I'd love for you to try it and share your feedback.
