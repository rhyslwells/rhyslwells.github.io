I often need a repeatable environment to explore and forecast with different models and parameters across time series data. That need motivated me to build Tempora, a Streamlit app for time series forecasting. 

Tempora lets users upload data, explore trends, run models like ARIMA or Prophet, and generate interpretable forecasts (without writing code). 

The goal being to make forecasting accessible  and simple for anyone working with time series data.

If you have time I'd love for you to try it and share your feedback
