## Introduction (DONE)

Once game data has been fetched, validated, and stored, the next challenge is extracting insight systematically and reusably. In my [Chess Analysis](https://chess-analysis.streamlit.app/) project, the `ChessAnalyzer` class handles this step.

Where `ChessFetcher` focuses on getting data , the analyzer focuses on you guessed it ... analysis, by summarising performance, identifying patterns, and producing features for visualisation and modelling.

This post walks through the design and outputs of `ChessAnalyzer`, using my own account data as an example.

---

## Position in the Pipeline

The analyzer sits downstream of `ChessFetcher`:

```
ChessFetcher -> ChessAnalyzer -> Insights / Features
```

**Input**: pandas DataFrame from fetcher
**Outputs**:

* Aggregated statistics (scalars or compact tables)
* Transformed DataFrames suitable for plotting
* Feature matrices for machine learning

No API calls, file I/O, or plotting is performed here. The analyzer operates purely on in-memory data.

---

## Design Principles

* **Pure analysis** – no external dependencies or side effects
* **Precomputed shared features** – calculated once at initialization
* **Composable outputs** – dictionaries and DataFrames, not side effects
* **Statistical restraint** – quantities reported; interpretation is external

---

## Initialisation and Derived Features

Derived features are computed once at initialization to maintain consistency across analyses.

```python
analyzer = ChessAnalyzer(df)
```

### Derived Columns

| Feature             | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `rating_diff`       | user-rating − opponent-rating              |
| `opponent_category` | Lower / Similar / Higher rated (+/-50 Elo) |
| `game_num`          | Sequential game index                      |
| `result_category`   | Win / Loss / Draw labels                   |
| `move_count`        | Number of moves (when PGN data permits)    |

Sample rows:

```
date        user_rating opponent_rating rating_diff opponent_category result_label
2025-09-15          463              255        208       Lower Rated          Win
2025-09-15          584              447        137       Lower Rated          Win
2025-09-15          672              561        111       Lower Rated          Win
2025-09-15          609              751       -142      Higher Rated         Loss
2025-09-15          678              637         41    Similar Rating          Win
```

## Overall Performance Statistics

Aggregates high-level metrics to summarise overall performance.

```python
stats = analyzer.get_overall_stats()
```

| Metric       | Value |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Total games  | 264   |
| Win rate     | 45.1% |
| Starting Elo | 463   |
| Current Elo  | 741   |
| Net change   | +278  |

**Visual Cue**: Small bar chart showing starting vs current Elo and win/loss proportion.

**Interpretation**: Provides a coarse summary of overall success and rating progression.

---

## Rating Dynamics

Tracks rating evolution and consistency.

**Trend over time**:

```python
trend = analyzer.get_rating_trend()
```

**Visual Cue**: Line chart of `user_rating` over time, with points for each game, highlighting streaks.

**Volatility and consistency**:

```python
volatility = analyzer.get_rating_volatility()
```

**Metrics**:

* Standard deviation of per-game rating changes: $\sigma \approx 16.1$
* Average rating change: ≈ 10.4 Elo per game
* Maximum gain/loss: +121 / −63

**Visual Cue**: Histogram of per-game rating changes to illustrate volatility.

Interpretation: High volatility indicates streaks or experimentation; low volatility reflects predictable outcomes.

---

## Performance by Opponent Strength

Analyzes outcomes relative to opponent rating.

```python
opp_strength = analyzer.get_performance_by_opponent_strength()
```

| Category       | Games | Win Rate | Avg Score |
| -------------- | ----: | -------: | --------: |
| Lower Rated    |    14 |   100.0% |     1.000 |
| Similar Rating |   245 |    42.4% |     0.449 |
| Higher Rated   |     5 |    20.0% |     0.200 |

**Visual Cue**: Grouped bar chart of win rate by opponent category.

Interpretation: Highlights competitive balance; poor performance vs lower-rated opponents signals inconsistency.

---

## Performance by Color

Compares results when playing White vs Black.

```python
color_perf = analyzer.get_color_performance()
```

| Color | Games | Wins | Win Rate | Avg Score |
| ----- | ----: | ---: | -------: | --------: |
| White |   132 |   56 |    42.4% |      0.45 |
| Black |   132 |   63 |    47.7% |      0.50 |

**Visual Cue**: Pie chart showing win proportion by color.

---

## Opening Repertoire Analysis

Identifies frequently played and effective openings.

```python
openings = analyzer.get_opening_stats(top_n=15)
```

* 160 unique openings
* Most frequent: 5.7% of games
* Best performing (≤5 games): Italian Game (75%)
* Worst performing (≤5 games): French Defense Knight Variation (25%)

**Visual Cue**: Horizontal bar chart of top 15 openings by frequency, color-coded by win rate.

---

## Time Control Performance

Evaluates results across time formats.

```python
tc_stats = analyzer.get_time_control_stats()
```

**Visual Cue**: Grouped bar chart of win/loss rate by time control.

---

## Game Duration Analysis

Quantifies correlation between game length and results.

```python
length_stats = analyzer.get_game_length_stats()
length_by_result = analyzer.get_game_length_by_result()
```

**Visual Cue**: Boxplot of game length grouped by result (win/loss/draw).

Interpretation: Short games indicate early blunders; long games suggest balanced or endgame-heavy play.

---

## Results Over Time

Aggregates outcomes across intervals to detect streaks and form changes.

```python
results_monthly = analyzer.get_results_over_time(period='M')
```

**Visual Cue**: Stacked bar chart of wins/losses/draws per month.

---

## Recent Form

```python
recent = analyzer.get_recent_games(n=10)
```

Shows the most recent games for short-term review.

**Visual Cue**: Table with colored indicators for win/loss/draw.

---

## Machine Learning Feature Preparation

Prepares pre-game features for predictive models, avoiding leakage.

```python
X, y = analyzer.prepare_ml_features()
```

*Feature examples*: user rating, opponent rating, rating difference, binary indicator for playing White
*Target*: 1 = win, 0 = loss/draw

**Visual Cue**: Heatmap of feature correlations to the target.

## Conclusion

`ChessAnalyzer` converts cleaned chess game data into structured, actionable insights. It supports:

* Descriptive statistics
* Exploratory analysis
* Dashboard visualisation
* Machine learning workflows

By separating data acquisition from analysis, it forms the analytical core of the pipeline, bridging raw games to interpretable, reusable insights.
