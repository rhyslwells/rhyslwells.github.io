### What I Want Next Year

Last year, a lot of my time went into managing how work appeared rather than what it produced.

It meant spending time on visibility, alignment, and stakeholder comfort. None of this is unusual. It is how many technical roles function once they sit close to decision-making.

But it also meant less time doing technical work that originally mattered at a level where they actually improve.


I feel that the work I have been doing to be shallow and not allowing for creativity. Busy is not fullining.

Next year, I want to focus on fullinign work.

I want work that is defined by sustained technical engagement. 
I want to work deeper on a projects on a few projects.

In practice, this looks like consolidation.A smaller, more deliberate technical surface area that I actually maintain and understand. Work that produces insights I can reason later
---------------------------

It also means choosing topics differently.

Not work selected because it is fashionable or easily justified, but work that raises real technical questions: where assumptions break, where data degrades, where operational constraints force trade-offs. Topics that require patience and reward depth, even if they are invisible for long periods.

There is less emphasis on constant output and more on accumulation: building internal libraries, reusable analyses, well-documented pipelines, and notes that compound over time. Work that makes future work easier, not just present work defensible.

External validation becomes incidental rather than primary.

Some of this work will never be presented. Some of it will only be useful to me. That is acceptable. The goal is not visibility but durability—technical understanding that holds up when conditions change or scrutiny increases.

What I want next year is not momentum for its own sake.

It is work that is slower, narrower, and more demanding. Work where progress is measured by clarity gained rather than attention received. Work that feels like engineering again, not positioning.

If you want, next we can:

* Strip this further into a **one-page personal operating principle**
* Convert it into **explicit constraints** (what you will not work on)
