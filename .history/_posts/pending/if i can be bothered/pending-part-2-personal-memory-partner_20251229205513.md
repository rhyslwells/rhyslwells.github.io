## What the Assistant Actually Does

At its core, the assistant is a **context-scoped retrieval system**. It behaves like a thinking partner that has read all your notes — but only surfaces what’s relevant to the problem you're currently exploring.



* **Retrieval-Augmented Dialogue (RAG)**
  It uses embedding-based retrieval to surface your most relevant notes or excerpts based on the question or comment.

* **Theme Detection and Evolution**
  Over time, the assistant notices recurring tags, concepts, and linked clusters. It can summarise or consolidate them into themes you can explore or refactor.

* **Reflective Prompting** - types of prompts
  It prompts with queries like:

  > “You’ve written about ‘bounded rationality’ in three places. Want a synthesis?”
  > “Your note on ‘operational triage’ overlaps with this theme on decision fatigue. Want to connect them?”

* **Memory Extension**
  When you forget where something lives, the assistant helps retrieve it by idea, phrase, or related concept

Quantifiys the number of related chunks to a query..

1. **You define context**:
   “Use notes tagged `#decision_theory` and `#systems_thinking`.”

Question formats: **You ask questions**:
   “What did I write about Gigerenzer’s distinction between risk and uncertainty?”
   “Have I ever related bounded rationality to infrastructure planning?”

Below is the same feature set rewritten as a **to-do checklist** using `- [ ]` formatting, suitable for Obsidian or GitHub task tracking. Descriptions remain minimal and implementation-oriented.

---

## Core Principle

* [ ] Define system as context-scoped retrieval and reflection over a markdown archive

---

## Core Retrieval

### #retrieval #rag

* [ ] Implement contextual semantic search constrained by tags, folders, or projects
* [ ] Support semantic recall when original phrasing is forgotten
* [ ] Build chunk-aware indexing for notes and sections
* [ ] Create scoped vector stores for active themes or projects

---

## Connections & Structure

### #classifier #ml

* [ ] Detect recurring concepts and cluster them into latent themes
* [ ] Track how themes evolve over time across notes

### #ml #graph

* [ ] Surface semantically related but unlinked notes
* [ ] Analyse link density to find over- and under-connected notes

---

## Reflection & Prompting

### #evaluation

* [ ] Generate reflective prompts for synthesis and consolidation
* [ ] Detect overlapping notes and suggest merge or refactor
* [ ] Identify thematic gaps where synthesis notes are missing

---

## Interaction & Workflow

### #ml_process

* [ ] Build explicit context declaration (tags, folders, time range)
* [ ] Enable iterative query-as-exploration workflows
* [ ] Reinforce retrieval ranking based on user interactions

---

## Archive Intelligence

### #classifier

* [ ] Classify note types (fleeting, permanent, literature, synthesis)

### #ml_process

* [ ] Enable temporal recall based on writing period or project phase
* [ ] Detect stale notes or themes that are no longer revisited

---

## Output & Synthesis

### #ml

* [ ] Generate on-demand thematic syntheses
* [ ] Preserve citations and backlinks in generated summaries

### #evaluation

* [ ] Suggest note refactors (split, merge, promote) based on structure and reuse
