## Original Intent Revisited
What problem was this meant to solve?
Do those motivations still hold?

## Outcome Summary
What exists at the end of the build?
What does the app demonstrably do?

## Comparison to Objectives
Which objectives were met?
Which were partially met or missed?

## Assumptions Evaluated
| Assumption | Outcome | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|----------|
|           |         |          |

## What Worked Well
Which decisions paid off?
Which constraints were helpful rather than limiting?

## What Did Not
Where effort was wasted or misdirected.
Which complexities were underestimated.

## Process Observations
What this project revealed about:
- Your design habits
- Your build workflow
- Your tolerance for uncertainty

## Reusable Lessons
What would you apply directly to the next project?
What would you explicitly avoid repeating?

## Next Steps
Is this project:

Why is that the correct outcome?
