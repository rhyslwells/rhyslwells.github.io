## Starting Point
What inputs came from the scoping phase?
Which assumptions were accepted going into the build?

## Design Choices
What architectural or structural decisions were made?
Why these choices over alternatives?

| Decision | Option Chosen | Trade-off Accepted |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|
|        |              |                    |

## Implementation Focus
What was prioritised during this phase?
What was intentionally simplified or ignored?

## Tools and Techniques
Key libraries, frameworks, or patterns used.
Brief rationale for each.

## Friction and Failure
What slowed progress?
What behaved differently than expected?

## Adjustments Made
Which earlier assumptions were revised?
Which design choices were changed mid-build?

## Current State
What works now?
What is fragile, incomplete, or provisional?

## Technical Debt Introduced
What shortcuts were taken knowingly?
Why were they acceptable at the time?

## Open Questions
What needs to be answered before further iteration?
What risks remain active?
