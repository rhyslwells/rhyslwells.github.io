REWORD

## Realities of the Corporate Hymn Sheet

At some point in your corporate journey, you'll be handed the hymn sheet — that soaring vision of what the company stands for. Innovation. Collaboration. Digital transformation. Customer centricity. The usual suspects.

It arrives via a branded video, complete with inspirational music, vague metaphors, and sweeping statements about "unlocking value through synergy." You’re invited to feel part of something bigger. You’re told this is the future.

And maybe, for a brief moment, you believe it.

### Good on Paper

To be fair, the hymn sheet is inspiring — in theory. Who wouldn’t want to work in a bold, forward-thinking organization where people collaborate seamlessly, embrace change, and use cutting-edge tools to solve big problems?

You can almost picture it. The glossy demos. The carefully curated success stories. The proof-of-concept slides showing how “AI can transform operations.”

Except… that’s not what it looks like on the ground.

### On the Ground: A Different Story

Most people aren’t resisting innovation because they’re stubborn. They’re resisting because they’re overloaded. Their systems are fragile. Their team is short-staffed. The workflow barely works as-is, and any change — no matter how well-intentioned — risks tipping things over.

Collaboration? Hard to prioritize when you’re firefighting. Digital transformation? Sure, but only if it doesn’t interfere with this month's targets. Experimentation? Great — if someone else does it.

When high-level change is handed down with no context, no space, and no support, it becomes just another task in an already unmanageable list. And often, what passes for implementation is a familiar dance: tick the box, reword the deck, act engaged, move on.

### When Real Innovation Comes from the Bottom

The irony, of course, is that the most practical innovations often come from people on the ground — the ones who see what’s broken and how it might be fixed. But if their ideas don’t align with the top-down narrative? They’re dismissed. Too niche. Too tactical. Not “strategic” enough.

So the cycle repeats. Central comms pushes a grand vision. Teams nod politely. No one changes anything. Cynicism deepens.

### Why It’s Frustrating

Because it could work. The ideas themselves aren’t the issue. In the right conditions — with support, with space, with recognition — these changes could be meaningful.

But that’s not how it plays out. Instead, you’re told to “drive change” without being given the time, budget, or authority to do so. You’re expected to contribute to a vision that never actually filters into your workload — except as an extra set of tasks. Which, of course, aren’t rewarded.

You’re doing more, for nothing.

There’s no bonus. No promotion. No reduction in responsibilities. No career benefit for the hours you spend translating vague aspirations into actual processes. It’s just more work.

And if you raise these concerns? You’re branded a blocker. Not on board with the journey. Not a team player.

So you quietly retreat into the safety of your core responsibilities. Deliver the work. Smile in the meetings. Keep your real thoughts to yourself.

### Some (Realistic) Suggestions

If leadership genuinely wants the hymn sheet to matter — beyond internal branding exercises — the following would help:

 Fund the change. Make improvement a line item, not an afterthought.
 Respect the burden. Understand that “just an extra meeting” or “small pilot project” adds real load to real people.
 Reward contributions. If someone makes your vision real, recognize it. Promotions. Visibility. Something tangible.
 Create clear channels. Ground-level ideas need somewhere to go. Right now, they evaporate.
 Stop the theatre. If the strategy is already set, don’t pretend you’re crowdsourcing it. People notice.

### Final Thought

The problem isn’t ambition. It’s detachment. Big-picture goals are worth pursuing — but only if they’re backed by ground-level action. Change doesn’t happen in slide decks. It happens in meetings, in shared folders, in the daily reality of constrained people doing their best with brittle tools.

If you want that hymn sheet to be more than corporate karaoke, then start with the people who are actually doing the work. Otherwise, expect more polite nodding, more box-ticking, and more quietly rewritten verses.
