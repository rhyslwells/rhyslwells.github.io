## Let Innovation Breathe First

A lot of businesses say they want innovation—but then build systems that quietly stop it from happening.

Usually, it’s not intentional. It comes from a place of wanting control, consistency, and good handovers. But when you try to control innovation too early, before it's had time to take shape, you end up shutting it down before it even starts.

Good ideas need room to grow. You can’t expect people to come up with something new and useful if the first thing they hit is a wall of approval processes, policies, or “that’s not how we do things here.” That kind of environment doesn’t just slow innovation—it tells people it’s probably not worth the effort.

One common mistake is trying to centralise innovation too tightly. Having a central team or committee might help keep things aligned, but it also creates a bottleneck. It discourages people from different teams from building things together or sharing early ideas. It becomes more about getting permission than getting started.

If you want innovation to happen, you have to create the conditions for it. That means building communities, encouraging open conversations, and helping people find each other across teams. The role of a central team shouldn’t be to approve or reject—it should be to support, connect, and guide. Think less gatekeeper, more gardener.

Governance and structure still matter—but only after something has started to grow. If you put rules in place too soon, you risk getting nothing at all.
