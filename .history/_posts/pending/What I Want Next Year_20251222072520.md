### What I Want Next Year

Last year, a lot of my time went into managing how work appeared rather than what it produced.

It meant spending time on visibility, alignment, and stakeholder comfort. None of this is unusual. It is how many technical roles function once they sit close to decision-making.

Over time, this shifted where my attention went. Less time was spent inside the technical work itself—at the level where understanding deepens and things genuinely improve.

The result was work that felt shallow and constrained. It left little room for creativity. Being busy was not fulfilling.

Next year, I want to focus on work that is fulfilling.

I want work defined by sustained technical engagement, where time is spent thinking, building, and revisiting ideas rather than constantly moving on. I want to go deeper on a smaller number of projects and see them through.

In practice, this means consolidation. A smaller, more deliberate technical surface area that I maintain and understand. Work that produces insights I can return to later without having to reconstruct the context.

It also means choosing topics differently.

I want to work on topics that raise real technical questions: where assumptions fail, where data degrades, and where careful investigation still reveals something new. These are problems that require patience and reward depth, even if they remain invisible for long periods.

I want to focus on work that compounds over time—building internal libraries, reusable analyses, well-documented pipelines, and notes that accumulate value gradually. Work that reduces friction in the future.

I want to move away from external validation.

Some of this work will never be presented. Some of it will only be useful to me. That is acceptable.

The goal is to build a foundation of technical understanding that holds.

This is slower, narrower work. It is more demanding. Progress is measured by clarity rather than activity, and value emerges over time.
