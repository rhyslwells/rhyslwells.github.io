## Modular, Practical Reference Repositories

For the past year, I’ve been developing two repositories: [ML_Tools](https://github.com/rhyslwells/ML_Tools) and [DE_Tools](https://github.com/rhyslwells/DE_Tools).

These are structured repositories designed to collect, distill, and organise key machine learning and data engineering concepts into concise, reusable notebooks. The goal is to provide well-scoped entry points into familiar and recurring problems-which are adaptable, lightweight structured anchor points. Perfect for quick orientation when revisiting a topic, and for knowledge portability across tools and teams.

Each repository is organised by topic (e.g., Classifiers, Regression). Within each topic, you’ll find small, focused notebooks containing, working examples and standard terms and techniques.

These repositories are maintained to be implementation-neutral, focusing on clarity and reusability over integration with specific packages or frameworks.

Where tools or packages are referenced, they are chosen for their practical utility.

These materials are used internally but are also designed to be shareable. The structure is modular so that other teams, researchers, or individuals can fork and extend them for their own knowledge workflows.

Both repositories are linked to the [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/), which contains longer-form context and additional links. Each notebook is referenced in the Archive and positioned within a broader technical or conceptual discussion.
