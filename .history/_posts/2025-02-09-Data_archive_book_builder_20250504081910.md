In progress...


This week, I mentioned I was exploring Honkit to produce books from notes. I’ve now set up the Data Archive Book Builder as part of my research workflow, allowing me to pull selected notes from the Data Archive and turn them into focused EPUBs and PDFs for modular research.

These curated books integrate well with tools like NotebookLM and Neo4j’s graph builder, helping me explore ideas more deeply and organize my research more effectively.

Next, I’ll be exploring semantic search across these documents in a GraphRAG setup, mapping graph relationships between key ideas (similar to how Neo4j operates), and setting up LLM-based querying to ask questions directly across my notes.

Excited to see how these tools can push my research even further. If you are interested in similar things it would be great to get in contact.
