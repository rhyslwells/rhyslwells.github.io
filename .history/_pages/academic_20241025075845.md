## Ph.D Thesis

I completed my PhD at The University of Liverpool in 2023 under the guidance of Nicola Pagani. My thesis focused on combinatorial algebraic geometry where I developed methods to computed stability conditions of Fine compactified Jacobians.

Fine compactified Jacobians for curves are determined by numerical polarisations, first introduced by Tadao Oda and C. S. Seshadri (here). 
We provide a calculator to compute the stability condition (for smoothable fine compactified Jacobians) which give a non-degenerate numerical polarisation ([link](https://github.com/rhyslwells/Stability_conditions_fine_compactified_jacobians/blob/master/Notebooks/2_phi_calculator.ipynb)).
