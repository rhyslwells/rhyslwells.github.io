Hi,

My name is Rhys Wells, I am based in Scotland. Posts here are for me to spread my thoughts and learnings. 

In regards to my work, I hope to use my skills to make a positive impact and make the world a better place. My approach follows my favourite saying,

> "If I need it, I will learn it,

> "if I learn it, I can teach it."
