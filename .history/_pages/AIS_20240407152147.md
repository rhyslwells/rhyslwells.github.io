The Amateur Investment Seminar (AIS) is a monthly discussion on investment strategy and financial education, where we

- share our insights on specific companies,
- analyse sector trends,
- and investigate investment opportunities.

We have a collaborative and friendly environment on our Discord channel (email for access) where we share resources and plan our monthly seminar.
