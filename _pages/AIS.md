The Amateur Investment Seminar (AIS) is a monthly discussion on investment strategy and financial education, where we

- share our insights on specific companies,
- analyse sector trends,
- and investigate investment opportunities.

We have a collaborative and friendly environment on our Discord channel (email for access) where we share resources and plan our monthly seminar.

We meet on the last Thursday of every month at 7pm GMT.

Additionally we have a collection of resources on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rhyslwells/AIS), where we share our research and analysis.

Notes from sessions will be posted here.
